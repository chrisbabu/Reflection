Reflection on lesson 2

Use of multiple git commands and trial runs

Staging area provides much more control on files to be commited. Not all files in working area needs to be included in commit.

Branch allows new feature development without risking the existing stable application

Visualization of branches provides info on missed out commits

Automatic commits would result in confusion as git is unaware on which code changes to commit. Resolving manual commit helps
identifying important line of codes that has to be changed.
